# password-strength-analyser

This project is a **fully functional Python tool** I developed to analyze password security and generate custom wordlists based on user information. It demonstrates practical skills in Python, GUI development, security concepts, and data manipulation.

## **What I Have Done**

- **Built a Password Strength Analyzer**  
  - Integrated the `zxcvbn` library to evaluate password strength.  
  - Provides a numerical score (0-4), estimated crack times, and actionable feedback.  
  - Supports both CLI and GUI for flexible use.

- **Developed a Custom Wordlist Generator**  
  - Generates wordlists using personal data like name, DOB, petâ€™s name, and favorite color.  
  - Applies casing variations, leetspeak transformations, and intelligent combinations.  
  - Includes common years, prefixes, and suffixes to create effective wordlists.  
  - Outputs ready-to-use `.txt` files for password cracking tools like Hashcat or John the Ripper.

- **Created an Intuitive GUI**  
  - Used Tkinter with a dark theme and customized styling for usability.  
  - GUI features two main tabs: Password Analyzer and Wordlist Generator.  
  - Includes show/hide password, file browsing, and log outputs for user feedback.

- **Command-Line Interface (CLI) Support**  
  - Designed for advanced users to quickly analyze passwords and generate wordlists.  
  - Fully functional via command-line arguments with flexible options.

- **Handled Data & Automation**  
  - Automatic NLTK word corpus download.  
  - Intelligent date parsing from user input.  
  - Efficient permutation and combination logic to produce high-quality wordlists.

- **Project Management**  
  - Used virtual environments for dependency management.  
  - Ensured cross-platform compatibility (Windows, macOS, Linux).  
  - Structured code for readability and future enhancements.
